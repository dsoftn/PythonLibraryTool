### Python Library Analizer

Welcome to our Python library information tool! With this program, you can enter the name of any Python library and view information on its classes, methods, functions, constants, and more. The information will be displayed in a tree view, making it easy for you to navigate and access the different components of the library. Simply enter the name of the library you're interested in and explore all the valuable resources it has to offer.

## How to begin:

 # (1.) Enter the name of the library you want to examine and hit Return.
Example:
#  	datetime
or
#  	sys
or
#  	matplotlib
You can also choose a certain part of the library.
Example:
#  	datetime.datetime
or
#  	matplotlib.pie
and you can also write:
#  	from datetime import datetime
or
#  	from PyQt5.QtCore import QThread

 # (2.) Press Enter and wait for data to be calculated.

 # (3.) Review the data.
The data is now recorded in the database and can be accessed quickly.

## Search:

 # Type expresion you want to search for in search box and hit Return.
Please note that our database only includes information on the direct subobjects of the Python library you selected, as well as any additional data that has been loaded as you navigate through the tree view. Therefore, any components that you haven't analyzed won't be included in the database. Additionally, you can select "Analyze all sub objects" in tree view context menu and and ensure that all data is available for search.

## Tree view context menu:

 # Delete object and all sub objects
Deletes the selected object and all its sub-objects.
 # Analyze all sub objects !
This option will analyze the selected object and all its sub-objects in depth. This is useful when you want to process and save all the information from the objects of a library to the database, that way every search of the database will give complete information. This is a one-time process and can be time-consuming for large libraries.
 # Search in this object
Searches only within the selected object and all its sub-objects. This is useful when you have a large number of analyzed libraries, so the search results of all libraries can sometimes be overwhelming.
